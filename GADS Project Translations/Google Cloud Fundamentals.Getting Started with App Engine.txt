#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

#Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

-Initialize App Engine.

-Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

-Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

-Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

#Steps
1. Initialize App Engine
Open and activate cloud shell
a) Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

b) Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

c) Navigate to the source directory:
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally
a) Execute the following command to download and update the packages list
sudo apt-get update

b) Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

virtualenv -p python3 venv

c) Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

d) Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies
pip install  -r requirements.txt

e) Run the application
python main.py

Please ignore any warning if any

f) In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application

g) To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service

3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:
a) Navigate to the source directory:
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

b) Deploy your Hello World application
gcloud app deploy
If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter

c) Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
gcloud app browse

4. Disable the application
You can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.
Disable it from thecloud console.

Exit the cloud shell
Exit
